# Titanic Survival Prediction – Data Mining Project

This project was developed as part of our Data Mining coursework. It focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic dataset using classification models. The main objectives included performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applying machine learning algorithms, and evaluating their performance.

We started by cleaning the dataset and exploring survival trends based on gender, class, age, fare, and other factors. After preprocessing, two models were implemented: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.

Logistic Regression was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, achieving a decent accuracy. Random Forest, being more complex and capable of handling non-linear patterns, outperformed Logistic Regression with an accuracy of **84%**.

### 🔍 Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation & Accuracy Comparison

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- Python  
- pandas & NumPy  
- seaborn & matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

### 📁 Files in This Repository:
- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook  
- `logistic_regression.ipynb`: Logistic Regression model implementation  
- `random_forest.ipynb`: Random Forest model and results  
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies  

### 📊 Results:
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 77%  
- Random Forest Accuracy: 84%  

This project helped us understand the practical application of classification models in real-world datasets, and how EDA supports model selection and improvement.
